# Frontend Coding Test

Contained within this repo is a series of problems, each problem is an HTML file that contains the explaination of the problem as well as a partial solution.

Please complete the HTML/CSS/JavaScript code in the problem file in order to solve it and send the completed code back to us to review. Feel free to put comments in the HTML file to explain your solution. Also **PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY THIRD PARTY LIBRARIES** to complete these.

One thing to keep in mind here is that these are fairly open-ended for a reason. We want to see your creativity and style, there is plenty of room for finesse, so please feel free to use it. Also these things shouldn't take you longer than a few hours, so please don't feel like you need to spend a day on it.

Have fun, show off, and please give us feedback so we can make this better!
